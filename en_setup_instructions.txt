NOTES FOR COMPLETING STUDY .csv file for en model

output_type:
This column lists output formats required, applied to the whole study, not individual scenarios.

---
PV:
---
Name of pv file - 1 year's output within DATA_EN_3\pv_profiles
For en or cp arrangement, pv file has single column, must be 'cp'
For btm_i,btm individual:  en has column for each unit, or if not, single 'cp' or 'total' column that is split equally
For btm_icp: en has column for eadch unit and cp. Or, single column: cp gets share according to load share; units get eqaul share of remainder
For Shared btm inc cp:  btm_s_c single 'total' or 'cp' column that is split according to instantaneous load between all units AND cp
For Shared btm Units only:btm_s_u single 'total' or 'cp' column that is split according to instantaneousload between all units EXCLUDING cp
For en_external scenario: cp tariff != TIDNULL

Scaleable PV:
-------------
filename of 1kWp PV output is pv_filename column
pv_scaleable = TRUE
pv_kW_peak = value to scaleby, eg 50 for 50kWp
In this case, pv_cap_id refers to a scaleable capex scenario with capex and repayments also scaled by pv_kW_peak
NB - use of this should be restricted to system sizes with equal $/kWp capex

-----
LOADS
-----
include folder name even if only a single file
folder within DATA_EN_3\load_profiles
If multiple loads for each scenario, they must all have the same list of customers within the folder,
BUT each scenario can have different number of residents, etc.

-----
CAPEX
-----
capex scenarios for en and pv are included in reference file
amortization a_term (years) and a_rate (%) are included in study_....csv file
a_rate is decimal e.g. "0.06" NOT "6%"or "6"
NB if capex_en_lookup has duplicate capex id's, it all goes to cock. (read_csv retrns series instead of single value).

-------
TARIFFS
-------
If all_residents has a tariff, it applies to all households (not cp) either internally for en arrangement or externally for bau btm etc.
If all_residents tariff is not given, each houshold can have its own tariff code
'cp' tariff:
-----------
In en scenarios, If ENO = stratabaody, cp tariff = TIDNULL,
		If ENO is not the strata  cp tariff is what strata pays ENO for cp load

'parent' tariff
---------------
For Non EN scenarios (bau, btm, cp_only, etc.), parent tariff must be TIDNULL, while cp tariff is paid by strata.DNULL

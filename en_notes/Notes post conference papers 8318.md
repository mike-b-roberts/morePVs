**Initial vb studies :**

·         envb1   No survey, warm temperate, all

·         envb2   Survey  has_ac

·         envb3   survey  not(has_ac)

all based on Huxham (plus bondi) cp

 

**Tasks**

**1.**       Include demand tariffs & discounts in model

**2.**       Work out desired outputs – graphical and tabular – and amend model

**3.**       Criteria for tariff design

**4.**       Design tariff options

1.            Bowyer, J., A. Bruce, and R. Passey, *Regulatory and Retail Arrangements for Community-owned Embedded Networks*, in *APSRC*. 2016: Canberra.

JB Tariff Scenarios:

 

Discounts calculated relative to origin TOU Standing offer, so penalises flat rate;

 

Scenario 1 – straight cost pass through: ‘causer pays’ network charges. Doesn’t allow for EN opex, but could use this with % on top for en.

Scenario 2 – TOU, shadow pricing of network & retail charges, with varying % discounts (applied to per kW and fixed charges)

Scenario 3 – Flat rate, shadow pricing of flat rate network and retail charges, varying discounts

Scenario 4 Solar TOU

 

Possible tariff scenarios (MR): As above plus:

·         Inclining block tariff for daytime period – ie quota of cheap daytime generation

·         ‘Causer pays’ plus % for EN

·         What if EN = retailer, so retail % required is lower??

 

Tariff design – need to consider separate components

Outputs – income for ENO, retailer, DNSP, TNSP

 

Tariff Design Criteria (JB)

1.       Maximise (?) ENO profit, or at least cover opex

2.       15% discount for all customers on TOU standing offer 

3.       Fairly allocated costs: Minimise ratio of max discount : min discount

4.       Incentivise solar TOU

5.       (Subjectively) ‘appropriate’ tariff

 

**Variable Tariff design criteria (MR)**

1.       Maximise ENO profit – monitor for each scenario. 

2.       All customers pay < standing offer (TOU AND Flat?)

Variable min discount for customers

3.       Fair cost allocation - as above or min std of discount? OR cost vs useage OR cost vs peak demand?

4.       Incentivise solar TOU?

5.       Some criteria on retailer income to ensure parent tariff is viable

6.       ???? Incentivise demand reduction – at time of EN peak?

 

**Outputs**

·         ENO income

·         Customer expenditure cf BAU

o   For each customer?

o   Average in building for each vb?

o   Average in vb and building?

o   Plot vs energy use or BAU cost or SC

·         Retailer income / profit?

·         DNSP / TNSP income?

·         Total site demand kWh – used to determine appropriate parent tariff

·         CO2 - externalities 

 

**JB calcs:**

**ENO external tariff costs =** DUOS total revenue + Retailer Total Revenue + CCF Total Revenue + TUOS Total revenue

Where:

**DUOS** = DUOS TOU volumetric charges + Fixed Charge **+ Peak demand charge (c/kVA/day) based on rolling max demand in 12 months**

 

**TUOS** = TUOS TOU volumetric Charges **+ Peak demand charge (c/kVA/day) based on rolling max demand in 12 months**

 

**CCF** = CCF Volumetric charges

 

**Retailer** Total – based on assumed 7c / kWh, no fixed or demand charges

Peak demand: is based on peak kWh half-hour period in peak time for whole year.

SHOULD THIS INCLUDE ASSUMED POWER FACTOR?

## Notes post conference papers 8/3/18

### 1.      EnergyCON:

**Inputs:**

·         Used 50 VBs for single building

·         2 PV systems : full roof capacity, and only north-facing roofs

·         3 EN capex scenarios

·         8yrs / 10 yrs annualised capex at 6%

·         Opex: $250 per customer NSW, based on retail.

·         BAU Tariff is SO TOU – 15%

·         Gateway Tariff: EA305 + 9.5c, +11.5c, FiT =0

·         EN Tariffs: TOU15, -20  / STS -35, -40 / STC -15, -20

**Results:**

·         TOU25 / STS40 / STC20 are comparable. TOU20 / STS35 / STC15 are comparable

·         STS is least equitable – 10% customers worse of with 40% discount

·         STC 15% savings to all, incentive for self-consumption

·         TOU25 and STC20 only tariffs that incentivise EN (at 9.5c gateway retail tariff)

·         11.5c & high cost- EN benefits marginal

·         Larger PV reduces EN income if not FiT (because export)

·         Smaller PV over 12 years is neutral / better (9.5c/11.5c)

| BENEFITS     | Tariff | Tenant | Landlord | Owner-Occupier |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------------- |
| Parent 11.5c | TOU25  | $144   | $96      | $240           |
| Parent 11.5c | STC20  | $120   | $121     | $240           |
| Parent 9.5c  | TOU25  | $144   | $155     | $299           |
| Parent 9.5c  | STC20  | $120   | $179     | $299           |

 

**Future:**

·         High self-consumption PV (no FiT) or export with FiT

·         CAPEX payback over lifetime of PV (e.g. 8/12/20?) 

o   Add inverter replacement

·         Look at demand shifting – impact on demand charges & on newtork

 

### 2.      APSRC

**Inputs:**

·         50 x VBs for 10 sites

·         Max roof PV

·         Compare system configs: BAU, BTM-I, BTM-ICP, BTM-S, EN, EN-PV

·         EN capex – 20k + 400/unit

·         Capex 12 years at 6%

·         En opex $250

·         BTM-S costs omitted

·         Tariffs – BAU TOU -15% + 12.5c FiT

·         EN Parent Tariffs: EA305/310 + 9.5c, FiT / no FiT

**Results:**

·         Looked only at total building cost / unit

·         **EN** benefits, esp for larger sites

·                                                             BTM-I reduces costs, benefits for low PV ratio / high SC 

(nb aggregated sc vs pv ratio:  

·         Adding PV to EN depends on SC/PV ratio, FiT 

·         With no parent FiT, EN may be worse than BTM PV

·         **BTM:** 

·         BTM-S PV costs less than BTM-I for low SC

·         For high SC, sharing has marginal benefit over BTM-I

**Future:**

·         Sensitivity of Building cost to parent retail tariff

·         Flat rate, demand-based, solar tariffs for parent and for  BTM / BAU

·         Shorter amortization than 12 yrs, Also longer. Look at 20-25 yrs

(And/or look at benefits pre-payback and post-payback)

·         Internal EN tariffs: distribution of costs and benefits

·         Impact of load aggregation and storage on value of embedded PV

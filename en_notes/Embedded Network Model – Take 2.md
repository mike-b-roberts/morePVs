8/3/18

See C:\Users\z5044992\Dropbox\UNSW\METHODOLOGY\EN Model\Embedded Network Model.docx for notes from 2 conference papers

·         Outputs:

o   Distribution of Costs / Benefits to stakeholders

o   Building Costs – related to value of PV etc.

·         Variable Parameters:

o   Technical Arrangement: BTMs / ENs

o   PV Sizing (PVR / SC)

o   Parent Tariffs: retail rate and FiTs

o   EN CAPEX

o   CAPEX Payback period and rate

o   Internal EN Tariffs: structures and rates

o   Demand shifting

o   Storage

Add externalities (CO2) to pricings where appropriate

Studies to do:

**1)**      **EN2: Distribution of Costs and benefits (**As EnergyCON but extended)

-          50 VBs , but for all 10 sites 

-          o/p: %Savings vs SC for different tariffs, Savings vs load?

-          o/p: EN Income vs tariffs / PV

-          o/p – Landlords vs tenants vs OO

-          Tariffs: TOU25, STC20, Solar Inclining Block (SIB)? ,Cost plus % for EN) (C+15)

-          PV x 2: a) max with FiT,  b) smaller PV for high SC (plot SC vs PV)

-          11.5c & 9.5c?

-          10/15/20 years??

2)      **EN1: Value of PV & Storage** (As APSRC but extended)

-          50VBS for 10 sites

-          Add cp only arrangement

-          o/p is total building cost

-          10/15/20 years capex payback

-          Add costs for BTM-s

-          Add **storage** – impact on total costs

3)      **EN2**: **Distribution of Costs and benefits** Using WWAPI Data:

-          Look at range of scenarios from above and apply to each building

-          O/p: total building costs

-          o/p look at each resident / owner individually

-          relate to h/h demographics
